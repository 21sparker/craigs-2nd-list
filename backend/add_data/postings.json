On the value side, you get built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth audio streaming technology. You can stream hi-res, lossless, and compressed formats from smartphone, tablet, PC, and NAS using our remote app for music selection and playback. The receiver also comes with app-controllable internet radio and music streaming services, so you\u2019ll never be short of music. On the performance side, six HDMI\u00ae inputs and two outputs support 4K and 3D passthrough, with lower-resolution video upscaled to 1080p on regular HDTVs (4K on compatible displays) using Qdeo\u2122 processing technology. An MHL\u2122 port handles hi-res video from smartphone and tablet, and there\u2019s a USB for audio playback from flash memory drive. Discrete WRAT amplifiers and Three-Stage Inverted Darlington Circuitry for the front and center channels deliver breathtaking surround sound, while MultEQ\u00ae from Audyssey ensures your speakers and subwoofers are calibrated for optimum response. You can even bi-amp your front monitors and drive audio in a second zone. Powerful, easy to use, and packed with convenient technology, the TX-NR626 is unbeatable at this pricepoint.\n\nWi-Fi and Bluetooth Streaming Technology\n\nThe TX-NR626 connects to the wireless home network without LAN cables or adapters.

And they\u2019re easily selectable using the receiver\u2019s GUI or the remote control app. Explore more than 10,000 radio stations and enjoy albums and playlists with theater-fidelity sound.\n\nNote: Availability of services depends on region. Some services may require a subscription and a firmware update.

On the critical front and center channels, Three-Stage Inverted Darlington Circuitry is used to handle reference-level playback without distorting.\n\nAudyssey MultEQ\u00ae\n\nMultEQ equalizes your system to tailor the sound to suit the unique shape of your room.

Then went to dealership and was told same it was the same problem again, had them replaced it over again. They left it even worse, all my check engines lights come on, they refused to fix or check it till I argued to pay more, they fixed it and gave it back to me. Few weeks later, shutdown again. Like I said it works here and there. I've put enough time and money, that I'm am done with it. I have a family so i was force to buy a new car, to get us back on the road. Bought the van a couple years ago. Have put new belt, starter, alternator, tires, etc. So let me know if interested, not in a hurry to sell so please no low ballers.
